Steve's No-Good-Very-Bad Jekyll Theme
=====================================

This is my custom Jekyll theme, initially created by  created by [Steven V. Miller](http://svmiller.com/), which is basically [Joel Glovier](http://joelglovier.com/)'s `jekyll-new` theme smashed with [Alex King](http://www.alexking.org)'s [Favepersonal](https://crowdfavorite.com/favepersonal/) theme for Wordpress. Then I took it from there and modified according to my need

Much of what is contained in here is derivative of those three works.

`css` and `_sass` directories also functional, if a bit cluttered. Do observe new colors I created for `$uva-dark-blue` and `$uva-orange` in `css/main.scss`.
