## Carrier Transport in Graphene [Aug 2014-Till Date]

We explore both analytical and numerical methods to understand various aspects of graphene’s fundamental electronic structure, device and circuit level properties. I am involved in developing multiple simulation tools (NEGF, semi-classical ray tracing) to explore electronic transport in 2D materials, to be specific Graphene

## Undergraduate Research -Tunnel FET [Feb 2011 - Mar 2012]
<p align="justify">
My Undergraduate thesis is on “Analytical Modeling of On and Off current of Gate on Source Tunnel FET”. This work was supervised by Dr. Md. Shofiqul Islam. Here we proposed a complete  analytical model of the TFET and insight into the working principle of the device, a TFET structure is used that has its gate placed fully on  the source not covering the channel at all. Using Kane’s model and the line tunneling concept, an analytical model is developed for the TFET’s tunnel current that includes both the drain voltage and gate voltage dependence. Important quantum phenomenon  –  subband quantization  is considered due to the narrow potential well. Particularly,  the discreteness of the subband energy levels will drastically affect the BTBT transition probabilities and hence the tunneling current. Whereas in Kane’s model the energy spectra of both the valence and the conduction bands are considered continuous, transitions from a valence band with a continuous spectrum of a conduction band consisting of discrete subbands  is considered. Thus, this thesis paper has successfully introduced the subband quantization phenomenon in the  analytical modeling of the TFET structure considered.
