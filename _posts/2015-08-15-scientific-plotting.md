Nothing new here, I just tried to summarize some useful link in one single article. We regularly need to plot data for publishing paper or giving presentation. For high quality image we may use the below softwares.

### Using Matlab:

Most of the students use MATLAB for research work.

>[PlotPub](http://masumhabib.com/publication-quality-graphs-matlab/) is a set of functions written in MATLAB by Dr. [K. M. Masum Habib](http://masumhabib.com/).

It is very easy to use and the most important thing is there are updates coming on regularly which increases the features day by day. After producing the figure save it as .eps format to have better quality.

### Other Softwares:

###### Windows:

-   [Origin Pro](http://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Products/Origin)
-   [DatPlot](http://www.datplot.com/download/) (Free)
-   [TeraPlot](http://www.teraplot.com/) (Student Version â€“ 1 Year Free)

###### OSX:
