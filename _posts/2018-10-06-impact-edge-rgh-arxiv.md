# Abstract 
We articulate the challenges and opportunities of unconventional devices using the photon like flow of electrons in graphene, such as Graphene Klein Tunnel (GKT) transistors. The underlying physics is the employment of momentum rather than energy filtering to engineer a gate tunable transport gap in a 2D Dirac cone bandstructure. In the ballistic limit, we get a clean tunable gap that implies subthermal switching voltages below the Boltzmann limit, while maintaining a high saturating current in the output characteristic. In realistic structures, detailed numerical simulations and experiments show that momentum scattering, especially from the edges, bleeds leakage paths into the transport gap and turns it into a pseudogap. We quantify the importance of reducing edge roughness and overall geometry on the low-bias transfer characteristics of GKT transistors and benchmark against experimental data. We find that geometry plays a critical role in determining the performance of electron optics based devices that utilize angular resolution of electrons.
