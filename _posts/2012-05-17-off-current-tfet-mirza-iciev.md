# Abstract 

A semiclassical model of band-to-band tunneling current in a reverse biased silicon p-i-n diode is presented in this paper. Due to the absence of a simple analytical model for the nanoscale reverse biased p-i-n diode, the working principle is generally not well understood. Using Kane's model, an analytical expression for the current through the nanoscale p-i-n diode in reverse bias is derived. Device simulation has been performed using SILVACO ATLAS. The obtained analytical expressions are compared with results from the simulator and good agreement at different reverse voltages is found.
