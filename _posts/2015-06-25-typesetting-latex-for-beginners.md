Most of the students in every department other than Computer Science are very afraid of using `LaTex` for writing scientific articles. That was the case for me too.

>But once you get used to it, you will find that it is the most handful thing for writing anything, literally anything.

So, here I will try to sum up the whole path you want to traverse for writing an article in `LaTex` which I hope will be just the beginning. I am sure you will use `LaTex` in every aspect of writing once you get used to it.

#### Why is it Important:

In a word, there is a huge amount of difference in the quality of the article produced by `LaTex` and any other software (i.e. Microsoft Word). Moreover, it is convenient to manage your article from citation, figures, indentation point of view.

>All the thing related to `LaTex` is free.

#### Basic Idea:

For writing articles in `LaTex` you need two thing.

1.  Compiler (MikTex)
2.  Any Editor ([TexMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), [WinEdt](http://www.winedt.com/))
You do not need to write all the codes for the article. There are plenty of templates available in internet. Download one, customize it and then compile your pdf.

Another thing is, if you want to use customized usepackage (similar to library in programming sense), you need to put the .sty file in your directory where you kept your main file (.tex).

#### Installation:

##### Compiler - Miktex

>Try to install the whole package not the basic one.

Otherwise you have to download some packages whenever you will use particular one other than the basic ones.
