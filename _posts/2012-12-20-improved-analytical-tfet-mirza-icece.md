# Abstract 

In this paper gate on source tunnel field effect transistor structure has been considered which is an unconventional one. In analytical derivation of current, impact of field-induced quantum confinement under the gate has been successfully incorporated which has resulted in a significant modification in tunneling current as compared to semiclassical models. The model has also used a more accurate potential term at the \\( Si/HfO_2 \\ )(Source/Gate oxide) interface in the source through some rigorous calculation of electron concentration in both strong and weak inversion regimes. Exponential integral function is introduced for the derivation of the analytical formula of the band to band tunneling current. The obtained analytical expressions are compared with results from the simulator and good agreement is found.
